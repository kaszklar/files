NEUROSCIENCE

History

trepanation: drilling or scraping a hole in the head, first started in Egypt - the brain was removed for mummification! Because they thought it was useless.

This is because the HEART was seen as the source of human consciousness. 

greek Hippocrates (father of modern medicine!) was the first to challenge this idea, largely because our perception organs like nose mouth eyes are near the BRAIN rather than the heart

Galen, a roman physician, furthered this idea when he noticed that gladiators lost their mental faculties after head injuries.

Luigi Galvani - 1700's researcher who started studying electrical excitability of neurons and muscles. 

Richard Caton 1875 discovered electrical activity in rabbits and monkeys

Camillo Golgi developed a staining procedure during the 1890's using silver chromate

Paul Broca, famous linguist, worked with brain-damaged patients and ended up suggesting that certain functions are localized to certain areas of the brain.
